Modal of deduction in the present & past:

might, may + verb (inf) ===========================> 50% chance possible <======== might, may + have + verb (past participle)
Example: - They may be in the car.			      |			   - I think I might have left the air conditioning on.
							      |
Must + verb (inf) ===========================> 99% chance possible (Positive) <=== must have + verb (pp)
Example: - That must be the main entrance		      |			   - It must have been someone close to him.
							      |
Can't + verb (inf) =========================> 99% chance impossible (Negative) <== can't + have + verb (pp)
Example: - You can't be bored already!			      |			   - She can't have driven there.
							      |

Passive Voice:

Object + to be + Verb (pp) + subject (Him, people etc..) 

Example of Active Sentence: - People eat sushi in many parts of the world.
The result of Passive use:  - Sushi is eaten by many people in many parts of the world.

Third Type conditional:

These sentences are in 2 halves (clauses)
- the if part (if clase) (verbs in past perfect)
- the other part where you can use: can, will, may, might, could and would (main clause)

Examples: 
- If you hadn’t stopped quickly, we would have crashed.
- I wouldn’t have gone to the party if you hadn’t persuaded me to go.

DRC (Defining Relative Clauses) vs NDRC (Non-Defining Relative Clauses):

- We use words to relate words: Who, Whose, Whom, Which, That, Where and When.
DRC: Kind of necessary and there is no virgules in the sentence
NDRC: Not necessary and we put it between 2 virgules.

Examples: The stairs which/that lead to the cellar are rather slippery. <=== DRC, Which or That
	  That block , which cost £5 million to build , has been empty for years <==== NDRC, two virgules + Which
